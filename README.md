## Short Description 

This React-based book search engine allows you to save your favorite books to your account, so you'd have a list of books to buy at the store. You can also edit and delete saved books to continually update your list based on current preferences.

## Deployed Link

https://pbyakod-book-search-engine.herokuapp.com/

## Installation Process

To install this engine on your local device, clone the repository using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/pbyakod/book-search-engine.git
```

Next, open up the root directory and run

```
npm i
```

This will install all the packages you need to run the app. Once complete, run 

```
npm run develop
```
from the same root directory to begin exploring the engine!

Note: Ideally, your computer will redirect you to the page automatically. If that doesn't happen, click on https://localhost:3000 after running the develop command.
